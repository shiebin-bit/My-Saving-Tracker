# My Saving Tracker

A utility app built with Flutter to calculate the time required to reach a savings goal. This project was developed for a lab assignment to demonstrate a solid understanding of fundamental Flutter concepts.

The application allows users to input a target savings amount, their starting balance and a recurring saving amount. Users can specify whether they are saving weekly or monthly. The app then calculates and clearly displays the total time needed to achieve the financial goal.
