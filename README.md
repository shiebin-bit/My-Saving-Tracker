# My Saving Tracker

A utility app built with Flutter to calculate the time required to reach a savings goal. This project was developed for a lab assignment to demonstrate a solid understanding of fundamental Flutter concepts.

The application allows users to input a target savings amount, their starting balance and a recurring saving amount. Users can specify whether they are saving weekly or monthly. The app then calculates and clearly displays the total time needed to achieve the financial goal.

## Inputs → Process → Output

- **Input**  
  - Target Amount: The total amount of money user wants to save.
  - Starting Balance: The amount of money user has already saved.
  - Saving Amount: The amount user will save per period
  - Frequency: The saving period, either 'Weekly' or 'Monthly'.
- **Process**: The app calculates the number of periods needed using the formula
  - 'Periods = (Target Amount – Starting Balance) / Saving Amount'
- **Output**: The app displays the total number of weeks or months required to reach the goal by rounded to one decimal place.

## Widget List used

- Scaffold: Provides the basic layout structure for both the splash screen and home page.
- AppBar: Displays the title of the app at the top of the home page
- Column: Used to arrange widgets vertically
- Row: Used to arrange widgets horizontally.
- Container: Used to create the decorative boxes for the input form and the result display, adding padding, borders and shadows.
- Text: Displays all static text, labels and the final calculated result.
- TextField: Used to get the numeric inputs from the user
- DropdownButton: Allows the user to select the saving frequency ('Weekly' or 'Monthly').
- ElevatedButton: Used for the "Calculate Duration" and "Reset" buttons, allowing the user to perform actions.
- SizedBox: Used to add spacing and gaps between widgets for a cleaner layout.

## Basic Validation Approach

The app handles invalid inputs gracefully by performing checks before any calculation:

- It verifies that the Saving Amount is a positive number (greater than zero).
- It verifies that the Target Amount is also a positive number.
- It checks that the Target Amount is greater than the Starting Balance (to ensure there is a goal to save for).

If any of these checks fail, the calculation is stopped, and a user-friendly error message is displayed in the result area.
